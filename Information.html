    <h1>Some more information...</h1>
    <p>You can reduce your screen time by taking breaks every 30 min to allow your eyes to relax. This will prevent sever headaches and eye damage in the long term. You can also spread out your activities such that activities which require screens are spaced out with other non screen activities inbetween them. Having a set recreational time for entertainment on screens also helps, the recommended time is around 2 hours for children above the age of 5. Here is a table showing statistics related to the average time spent in front of a screen in certain age groups.</p>

  <p>As the world is slowly coming back to normal, as schools and offices have started to reopen, the face to face interactions are slowly increasing. In order to reduce the screen time, the most basic tips that can be suggested would be to start by focusing on increasing your face to face interations. Rather than spending a lot of your time watching shows and movies, you can set dedicated times where you watch them, and limit them to an hour about two times a week. Increase face to face interactions by going down and spending more time with your friends. This will help you not only reduce eye strain but also stay more healthy as you are spending more time with people you enjoy hanging out with. On the topic of reducing eye strain, takng small breaks between your screen time rather than staring in front of a screen for a long period of time, taking short breaks reduces your  eye strain by a significant amount. Methods like the 20 20, where you spend 20 minutes in front of a screen, then close your  eyes for just 20 seconds, and continue working reduces eye strain a lot. Espeacially on mobile phones, mainting a proper posture is also curcial. A lot of the times people just keep bending their neck, and slouching whilst looking at their phone, and due to that they not only hurt their eye, but their neck and back as well. All mobile devices have an inbuilt bluelight filter, turning that on reduces the harmful rays being emitted by the phone and harming your eyes. Start by some of these basic tips, and also use our app, <i>Sched</i> more often in order to maximise your productivity whilst keeping tabs on your eye strain.</p>
